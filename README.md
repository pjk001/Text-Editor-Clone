To use the text editor, please make an account first, following the link on the login page. You can then access a home page containing a collection of all your documents after logging in. 

To create a new document, press the create button, which will make a pop-up. To make the document, input your desired title, and press the Add button. This will then create the document within the grid on the home page. To view the document, click on its icon, and it will take you to the document's editor page, where you can add text. The document will automatically save the text you input at periodic intervals, and will display a pop-up when it has done so successfully. You can also upload a file to this document by using the **Upload** button within the document editor page to select a file and append its contents to the end of the document. When you select your file to upload, keep in mind our app only supports *.txt* and *.md* files. You can also use the **Export** button to export the document as a pdf or markdown file.

To share this document with other users, press the share button, which will open a pop-up containing the shared users. To add another user, input their email into the input box, select the permission you wish them to have using the drop-down menu, and then press the gray '+' button on the left. You can also edit user permissions using the drop-down menus. 

To go back to the home page, press the **Home** button. If you wish to delete the document, you can also press the **Delete Document** button, which will delete the document and take you back to the home page. 

Back at the home page, you can view your collection of documents, included those shared with you. The documents display their names at the top, with small snippets of their contents, as well as their last updated date. In addition, you can use the search bar at the top to search for documents by name.
